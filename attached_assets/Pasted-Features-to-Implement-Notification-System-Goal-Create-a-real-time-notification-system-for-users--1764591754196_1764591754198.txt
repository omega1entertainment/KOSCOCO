Features to Implement:

Notification System

Goal: Create a real-time notification system for users to receive alerts about significant activities related to videos.

Requirements:

Send real-time alerts when:

Videos receive votes (likes, upvotes).

New comments are posted on videos.

Videos reach specific milestones (e.g., 100 views, 1000 views).

Content achieves phase achievements (e.g., content progressing through different stages like editing, uploading, etc.).

Implement different types of notifications for users:

Video Creators: Notifications about engagement (comments, likes) and milestones.

Viewers: Alerts for updates to videos they are subscribed to, or videos that they liked.

Support push notifications and in-app notifications.

Scheduled Publishing

Goal: Enable creators to schedule their videos for automatic publishing at optimal times.

Requirements:

Allow creators to select a date and time for when the video should be published.

Implement a recommendation system to suggest optimal publishing times based on user engagement patterns (e.g., when most viewers are active).

Provide feedback for creators regarding successful scheduling and any errors in scheduling.

Allow creators to queue multiple videos for automatic uploads over time.

Personalized Recommendations

Goal: Implement an AI-powered recommendation engine that suggests videos to users based on their watch history and preferences.

Requirements:

Use machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and generate tailored video recommendations.

The recommendation engine should consider:

Watch history (videos watched, liked, commented on).

User preferences (e.g., categories, genres, types of content).

Provide options for users to personalize or filter their recommendations based on their interests.

Watch Lists & Favorites

Goal: Enable viewers to save videos they want to watch later and create personalized collections.

Requirements:

Users can save videos to a watch list for later viewing.

Allow users to favorite videos and categorize them into custom lists (e.g., "My Favorites," "Must Watch," etc.).

Support easy access to the watch list from the user profile page or a dedicated section on the platform.

Optionally, integrate a recommendation system that can suggest videos based on the user’s watch list and favorites.
